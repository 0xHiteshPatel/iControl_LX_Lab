Lab 4.2 - Review the HelloWorld extension via iControl REST
-----------------------------------------------------------

Its time to take a look at your new iControl LX extension in action.


Task 1 - Verify the iControl LX extension is working

In your web browser, navigate to:

``https://10.1.1.12/mgmt/ilxe_lab/hello_world``


You could also use `curl` in CLI:

``curl -u admin:admin https://10.1.1.12/mgmt/ilxe_lab/hello_world``

Or a REST client like POSTMAN.


Task 2 - Take a break!

Congratulations!!!! You've just modified the behavior of the F5 iControl
REST API. Now, take a moment to think about what workflows you could implement
to make life easier.
