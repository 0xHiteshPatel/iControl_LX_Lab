Lab 4.2 - Review the HelloWorld extension via iControl REST
-----------------------------------------------------------

Its time to take a look at your new iControl LX extension in action.


Task 1 - Verify the iControl LX extension is working

In your web browser, navigate to:

`https://<ip_address>/mgmt/ilxe_lab/hello_world`


You could also use `curl`:

`curl -u username:password https://<ip_address>/mgmt/ilxe_lab/hello_world`

Or a REST client like POSTMAN (which is awesome).


Task 2 - Take a break!

Congratulations!!!! You've just modified the behavior of the F5 iControl
REST API. Now, take a moment to think about what workflows you could implement
to make life easier.
