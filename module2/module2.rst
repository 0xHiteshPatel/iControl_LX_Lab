F5 iControlLX Extensions Training Lab
======================================

Module 2 - Interacting with an iControlLX extension
---------------------------------------------------

In module 2 we are going to introduce the basic themes and then review an
iContolLX extension.

The Lab Environment
-------------------

The following exercises will be performed on the iWorkflow platform. If you
don't have one, grab yourself an eval license! While the iControlLX framework
does run on both BIG-IP and iWorkflow, there are many workflows that don't make
sense to run directly on the BIG-IP. For example, if we developed an extension
that presented the status of a Fleet of BIG-IP devices, it would make far more
sense to do this from a central platform, than at each individual BIG-IP.

This is the environment for the Training Lab:
